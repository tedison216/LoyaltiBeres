```sql
-- Add is_temp column to profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_temp BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_is_temp ON profiles(is_temp);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_phone ON profiles(phone);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_email ON profiles(email);
