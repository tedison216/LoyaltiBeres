# Branding & Admin Login Updates

## âœ… Changes Made

### 1. App Name Changed
**From:** LoyaltiBeres  
**To:** Irba Steak

**Files Updated:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Landing page title
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login page title

### 2. Hidden Admin Login Improved
**Old Method:** Type "admin" anywhere on landing page (too obvious)  
**New Method:** Small subtle button at bottom-right corner

**Changes:**
- Removed keyboard shortcut listener
- Added small "admin" text link at `bottom-4 right-4`
- Very subtle styling: `text-white/30` (barely visible)
- Hovers to `text-white/50` (slightly more visible)
- Much less obvious than the hint text

### 3. Admin Toggle Hidden on Customer Login
**Problem:** When clicking "Customer Login", admin option was still visible  
**Solution:** Admin toggle only shows when accessed via admin link

**How it works:**
- Customer clicks "Customer Login" â†’ No admin toggle shown
- Admin clicks small "admin" button â†’ Admin toggle appears
- Uses URL parameter `?role=admin` to detect admin access

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Changes

### Landing Page (app/page.tsx)
```
Before:
- Title: "LoyaltiBeres"
- Hint: "Admin? Type 'admin' on this page" (obvious)

After:
- Title: "Irba Steak"
- Small "admin" link at bottom-right (subtle)
```

### Login Page (app/auth/login/page.tsx)
```
Before:
- Title: "Irba Steak" (already correct)
- Admin toggle: Always visible

After:
- Title: "Irba Steak" âœ“
- Admin toggle: Only visible when ?role=admin in URL
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Improvement

The admin login is now much more discreet:
- âœ… No obvious hint text
- âœ… Small text that blends with background
- âœ… Only visible if you know where to look
- âœ… Admin toggle hidden unless accessed via admin link
