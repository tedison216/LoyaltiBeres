# Implementation Notes - Pagination & Transaction Management

## Summary of Changes

This implementation adds pagination to all admin pages and fixes transaction deletion with proper status tracking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Pagination (10 items per page)
- ✅ **Redemptions page** - Paginated with status filter tabs
- ✅ **Customers page** - Paginated customer list
- ✅ **Transactions page** - Paginated with multiple tabs

### 2. Transaction Tabs
- ✅ **Today** - Shows only today's active transactions
- ✅ **Older** - Shows transactions before today with date filter/search
- ✅ **Cancelled** - Shows cancelled transactions with delete option

### 3. Transaction Status Management
- ✅ Transactions now have a `status` field ('active' or 'cancelled')
- ✅ Cancelling a transaction marks it as 'cancelled' (not deleted)
- ✅ Cancelled transactions automatically deduct points/stamps via database trigger
- ✅ Only cancelled transactions can be permanently deleted
- ✅ RLS policy ensures only cancelled transactions can be deleted

## Database Changes

### Schema Updates (`supabase/schema.sql`)
1. Added `status` column to `transactions` table
2. Added index on `status` field for performance
3. Updated RLS policies for transaction updates and deletions
4. Modified `update_customer_balance()` trigger to only add points for active transactions
5. Added `handle_transaction_cancellation()` trigger to deduct points when cancelled

### Migration File
- Created `supabase/migration_add_transaction_status.sql` for existing databases
- Run this migration to update your Supabase database

## How to Apply Changes

### For New Databases
Use the updated `supabase/schema.sql` file

### For Existing Databases
Run the migration:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- supabase/migration_add_transaction_status.sql
```

## TypeScript Updates

### `lib/types/database.ts`
- Added `TransactionStatus` type
- Updated `Transaction` interface to include `status` field

## UI Changes

### Redemptions Page (`app/admin/redemptions/page.tsx`)
- Added pagination controls (Previous/Next buttons)
- Shows page number and total pages
- Maintains filter state across pages

### Customers Page (`app/admin/customers/page.tsx`)
- Added pagination controls
- 10 customers per page

### Transactions Page (`app/admin/transactions/page.tsx`)
- Added 3 tabs: Today, Older, Cancelled
- **Today tab**: Shows only today's active transactions
- **Older tab**: Shows past active transactions with date filter
- **Cancelled tab**: Shows cancelled transactions with permanent delete option
- Cancel button (trash icon) marks transaction as cancelled
- Delete button (trash icon in Cancelled tab) permanently removes transaction
- Added pagination for all tabs
- Shows transaction date and status

## User Flow

### Cancelling a Transaction
1. Admin clicks trash icon on active transaction
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Transaction status changes to 'cancelled'
4. Database trigger automatically deducts points/stamps from customer
5. Transaction moves to "Cancelled" tab

### Permanently Deleting a Cancelled Transaction
1. Admin navigates to "Cancelled" tab
2. Clicks trash icon on cancelled transaction
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. Transaction is permanently deleted from database
5. No points/stamps are affected (already deducted when cancelled)

## Security

- RLS policies ensure only admins can cancel/delete transactions
- Only cancelled transactions can be permanently deleted
- Database triggers ensure data consistency
- Points/stamps are automatically managed by triggers

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test pagination on all three pages
- [ ] Test transaction creation
- [ ] Test cancelling active transaction (verify points deducted)
- [ ] Test deleting cancelled transaction
- [ ] Test date filter on "Older" tab
- [ ] Test tab switching maintains correct data
- [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Test with multiple pages of data
