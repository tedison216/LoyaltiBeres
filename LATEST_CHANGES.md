# Latest Changes Summary

## 🎉 All Requested Features Implemented!

### ✅ Customer Management Enhancements

**New Features Added to `/admin/customers` page:**

1. **Edit Customer Details**
   - Click blue Edit icon on any customer card
   - Update name, phone, email
   - Instant validation and feedback

2. **Adjust Points/Stamps Directly**
   - Click green Coins icon on any customer card
   - Choose to Add or Subtract
   - Enter amount
   - Preview new balance before confirming
   - Works with both stamps and points mode

3. **Delete Customer**
   - Click red Trash icon on any customer card
   - Confirmation dialog with warning
   - Cascades to delete all customer's transactions and redemptions
   - Cannot be undone

**UI Improvements:**
- Three action buttons on each customer card:
  - 🔵 Edit (blue) - Update customer details
  - 🟢 Adjust (green) - Modify points/stamps
  - 🔴 Delete (red) - Remove customer
- Modal dialogs for all actions
- Real-time balance preview
- Clear visual feedback

---

### ✅ Pagination (All Pages)

**Implemented on:**
- ✅ Redemptions page (`/admin/redemptions`)
- ✅ Customers page (`/admin/customers`)
- ✅ Transactions page (`/admin/transactions`)

**Features:**
- 10 items per page
- Previous/Next navigation buttons
- Page counter (e.g., "Page 2 of 5")
- Maintains filter/tab state
- Disabled buttons at boundaries
- Efficient database queries

---

### ✅ Transaction Management Overhaul

**Three Tabs:**
1. **Today** - Active transactions from today only
2. **Older** - Past active transactions with date search
3. **Cancelled** - Cancelled transactions with delete option

**Date Filter:**
- Available on "Older" tab
- Search by specific date
- Clear button to reset filter

**Transaction Actions:**
- **Cancel** (Today/Older tabs): Marks transaction as cancelled, auto-deducts points
- **Delete** (Cancelled tab): Permanently removes cancelled transaction

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Transaction deletion now properly marks as cancelled first
- ✅ Points/stamps automatically deducted via database trigger
- ✅ Only cancelled transactions can be permanently deleted
- ✅ Proper SQL policies prevent unauthorized deletions

---

   - Added `status` column: 'active' | 'cancelled'
   - Added index on status for performance
   - Updated RLS policies for update/delete

2. **Profiles Table**
   - Added delete policy for admins to remove customers

3. **Triggers**
   - `update_customer_balance()` - Only adds points for active transactions
   - `handle_transaction_cancellation()` - Deducts points when cancelled
